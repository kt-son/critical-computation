        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        At the worst of my depression, I calculated the worth of life/living as finding more things that give it meaning than things 
        that make it dreadful. Some days ended feeling like it wasn't worth it. I think I trekked through those years trying to squeeze 
        meaning from every remotely joyful thing. This is a game of trying to find living worth it. 
        Avoid the things that weigh life down while chasing for things you (I) derive joy from!
      </p>

        I initially wanted to simulate this "balancing act" through a game that simulates a scale. 

        
        However, the objective of the game was to have <b>more</b> "joys" than "fears," instead of trying to attain a 50:50 balance. </br></br>  
</p>
        
        After a few sketches, I decided to express the objective through the emotion/facial expression of the protagonist. </br></br>

    <p>
      Finding that the layout wasn't conducive to the mechanism of the game, I played around with different dimensions and landed on a view
      that would place the "meaning" panel on one side and "weight" panel on the other, with animations indicating progress on each side.

      <p>
        My life view (?) has changed slightly since these years I reminisce on. For instance, instead of focusing on difficulty as something
        to avoid, I am starting to accept it as part of living & learning (although this can only happen in the luxury of baseline stability).
        There's just as much bad things as there are good things. 
        A good way to enhance this project would be incorporating more stages (ie. grad school) that feature this perspective shift with
        different interactions.
