        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        The weather has been all over the place recently. I start to sweat on my walk to the subway lugging a jacket, only
        to find out that the jacket was too thin for the nighttime temperature. For the data portrait assignment, I wanted
        to work with the joy and limitations of picking Fall outfits.

        I began logging data based on places I'm heading to & fro. I broke them down to this set of intervals:
        <ol type="1">
          <li>From my apartment to the subway stop </li>
          <li>From my subway stop to the destination subway stop (while on the train)</li>
          <li>From the destination subway stop to my destination</li>
          <li>Whilst at my destination</li>
          <li>From the destination to back home</li>
        </ol>
        
        I quickly realized that these fields were not only inflexible, but also not representative of every single day.
        There was one day that I didn't take the subway to get to my destiation, and I made multiple destinations on a few
        days. I also realized that the daily temperature range was much bigger than I thought it'd be, and that picking an
        appropriate outfit that will keep me cool & warm enough was harder than I thought. 
</p>
  
        I switched my fields to the number of times I felt I hot & cold instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pulling from the viral show with a piercing commentary was fun, but I wish I had more time to study the traditional 
        patterns and played around with the meaning of them to create an interaction that explored those concepts. </br></br>
