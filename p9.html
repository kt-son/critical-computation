        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        This experimental camera is an homage to the dear childhood friend Patrick Star, as well as a play on the idea of 
        our digital bodies being unconscious and overly conscious of being seen & tracked at all times. I thought "Who are you people"
        relates heavily with the idea of "liquid surveillance" Xin introduced during the 
        <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEeIhb8I34k&list=PLhlnwyfMOozUYusIdhgqHBhtq7vUhNDGv&index=11">lecture on Consentful Interface</a>.
        <i>Who</i> are the people watching us? How long are they watching for, and who is to follow next?

      <h1>
        Design Process
      </h1>
  <p>
    For this project, I most wanted to play with facial recognition and specifically, facial expression recognition. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Flowchart idea 1:</b>
  </p>
      <p>
         <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/698becb7-bcb5-4208-b71f-b08e28ed8c4f%2Fconcept1.jpg?v=1638299314893" width = 700>
       
        
        
        At first, I didn't think my camera would need many steps or processes to be turned into a consentful interface that follows the 
        <a href="https://www.andalsotoo.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Building-Consentful-Tech-Zine-SPREADS.pdf">F.R.I.E.S. framework</a>. 
</br></br>I knew I wanted to introduce the camera, and on the same introductory page, clarify a few things:

    <ol type="1">
        <li>The app will use your device's camera</li>
        <li>The recording is not being accessed by anyone else</li>
        <li>The recording is not stored anywhere</li>
        <li>The user can quit at any time</li>
      </ol>
Simulating the experience using this flowchart, I realized the introductory page contains too much information to be absorbed
on a single page.</br></br>  
</p>
<p>
    <b>Flowchart idea 2:</b>
  </p>
      <p>
         <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/698becb7-bcb5-4208-b71f-b08e28ed8c4f%2Fconcept2.jpg?v=1638299340957" width = 700>
       
        Walking through the first concept, I also felt that there is a need to ask for consent regarding the audio clip that gets played
fairly suddenly. I'm not sure if it's my own particularity, but I tend to feel almost invaded if a webpage or an app generates unexpected
(extent of) stimuli.</br></br> Initially, I was going to give the user the option to turn audio on/off during the experience, but given that
the audio clip is a very short spurt, felt that the experience will be more comprehensive if the decision was made prior to the experience.
</p>
  <p>
    <b>Final flowchart:</b>
  </p>
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/698becb7-bcb5-4208-b71f-b08e28ed8c4f%2Fflowchart-01.png?v=1638298375143" height = 450>

<p>
  The final flowchart thus
     <ol type="1">
        <li>1.  Breaks down the introductory page to 2 steps: one screen showing the title of the app, and the next screen walking the user through the 
       webcam use</li>
        <li>2.  Gives the user the option to enter the experience with or without sound</li>
      </ol>
</p>
 

      </p>


      <!-- 4. reflection -->
      <h1>
        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        I tried to follow the F.R.I.E.S. framework by
           <ol type="1">
        <li>Having users make the decision with information on what the interface does, and without pressure</li>
        <li>Using clear and accessible language explaining what goes into it</li>
        <li>Giving users the option to reverse their decision and quit/restart the camera</li>
      </ol>
    With this interface, users can actively consent to use none, parts, or all of the elements of the camera, which drastically contrasts
with the previous experience that immediately prompts the camera and sound without the users' awareness.
</br>
