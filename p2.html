      <p>
        This week, we learned how to randomly generate values, incorporate mouseX and mouseY coordinates, and interact with
        mouse clicks and mouse/key presses.
        I wanted to create a playful interaction that combines all of these elements into one.

        Initially, I set up different variables for R/G/B values for each part of the face: the face shape, eye color,
        freckles, nose, and lips. Then, I dug into limiting the ranges of some of those components by fixing them with a set
        of RGB values and adding/subtracting a randomized amount. Eventually, I ended up just randomizing the face
        color, and played around with blend modes to ensure all of the components on the face would be determined relative to
        the main color, and remain visible and compatible with the face color. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I incorporated the mouse coordinate interaction by adding a stretching bone. I also changed up the eye movement 
        and facial expression of the dog to follow the magic bone.

      <p>
        The fish bones were tricker to make, and it took me a while to figure out how to continuously add lines with a set 
        interval in between. I recalled the interactivity from Leffin's zipper from last class, and asked if I could play
        around with the for statement he used to add the teeth. Upon much trial and error, it worked!

        In the ideation stage, instead of randomizing the RGB values or size of shapes, I wanted to blend shapes that comprise of my 
        drawing of a cat (ie. pointed ears, triangular nose) and those of my dog dawing (ie. long ears, round nose), and 
        then pick random points in that transition (ie. from a triangle to an ellipse) to create mid-stage creatures
        between a dog and a cat. Realizing that blending shapes isn't in the scope of the project, I pivoted to switching
        from a dog and a cat using the system variable keyIsPressed, and used the randomization effect to determine the RGB 
        values of the face and the accompanying snack. I hope to soon learn how to blend shapes and generate various types of catdogs.
