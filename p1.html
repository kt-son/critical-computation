        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        In this project, we were asked to recreate a lost object in a classmate's memory 
        through their written description of the item. I got to work on a pearl necklace my
        classmate Nicky lost.  
  


        
      </p>

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        Nicky's description of her pearl necklace was as follows:
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>It has gold chains and once worn the chain rests around my collar bone area </li>
        <li>The necklace has 1 pendant made out of pearl attached to it</li>
        <li>The pendant is a round white pearl held by a silver pendant holder</li>
        <li>Pearl is in the middle and pendant that holds it molds to the pearl on the top like the pearl is wearing a hat</li>
        <li>The pendant holder is rectangular</li>
      </ol>

<!--       <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/87836090-8683-448f-a8fb-3af0c0f82bac%2Fworksheets-03.png?v=1598505804708"
        />
      </div> -->

      <p>
        I first drew out basic components Nicky laid out in her descriptions, and matched them
        with the 2D primitives we learned about. The pearl (being a perfect white circle) and the
        pendant holder (given the description of being a rectangle) were very straightforward to
        depict through the 2D primitives. The chain was a little trickier, but the color detail Nicky
        provided was enough to convey the image of a gold necklace chain.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Wanting to add details beyond the design of the necklace, apply functions like rotate(), 
        push()/pop(), and blendMode(), and to learn additional p5.js 
        features, I explored ways to convey the meaning of losing an object. Through the teardrops 
        that follow the cursor, I wanted to illustrate the sentiment of losing a meaningful item, 
        and with necklace's frowny face, I wanted to personify the loss on the part of the necklace 
        as well. When you click the screen (symbolizing a "search" for the lost item), the frown 
        momentarily turns into a smile, denoting a moment of hope that the necklace may feel when it 
        feels missed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Given the image of a "pearl necklace" I had in my head, interpreting Nicky's language
        wasn't very difficult. Even minor details that could've been tricky to either interpret
        or illustrate digitally were all solved by following her descriptions (i.e. "gold" chain,
        "rectangular" pendant holder). 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first began drawing the object using 2D primitives and simple curves, I wasn't
        really seeing the benefit of using code vs using vector graphics editor like Illustrator.
        But once I started playing around with mouse interactivity like location coordinates and 
        clicks, I was able to get a lot more creative with not only the visual expression, but also
        the interpretation of the lost item & what it means for the ex-carrier and the object. 
        I am very excited to learn more and apply new concepts with intention and creativity!
